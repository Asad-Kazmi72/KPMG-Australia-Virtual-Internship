📊 Unveiling The Code for Data Insights as Virtual Experience Program Participant DATA ANALYST at KPMG Australia through Forage  🚀



Sharing my journey of analyzing customer data for actionable insights! 



🔍 I started by understanding customer details, purchases, and behavior, using visualizations to spot trends.



📊 Numeric columns like past purchases and prices were explored using histograms and plots to understand distribution.



📊 I engineered features like customer age and purchase frequency, adding depth to our analysis.



🔍 I explored questions like how gender and car ownership impact purchasing patterns.



📈 Using regression, I predicted purchase amounts, while clustering helped segment customers effectively. 🎯
